Mathematical Library for Critical Systems
==========================================

The LibmCS library has been developed by re-engineering the ``libm`` included in the ``Newlib`` library version 4.0.0. The work has been carried out under ESA Contract No. 4000130278/20/NL/AS.

Whenever changes were made to ``Newlib`` after version 4.0.0 they were checked and tested before being added to the library. Only those changes that made sense to be a part of the library were added.

The following pages in this documentation try to give a xenodochial introduction into LibmCS to the user.

This user manual also contains the :ref:`ICD <ABBR>`, most of its information can be found in the :ref:`Reference Manual`.
