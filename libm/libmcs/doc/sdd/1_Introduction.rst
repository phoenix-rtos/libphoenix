This document is the :ref:`SDD <ABBR>` for the development of a qualified mathematical library for critical systems and is prepared in response to ECSS-E-ST-40C :ref:`[AD01] <AD>`, section F.2.

Its purpose is to describe the software architectural design and the software detailed design, by listing the software components, explaining the purpose of each and documenting the design decisions which led to
the implementation of the software as is. It further includes the internal interfaces design.

The mathematical library is an :ref:`ECSS <ABBR>` category B software.
