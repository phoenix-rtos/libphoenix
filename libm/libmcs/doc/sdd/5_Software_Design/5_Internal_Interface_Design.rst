Internal Interface Design
-------------------------

.. raw:: html

   <!--
   a. The SDD shall describe the internal interfaces among the identified software components.
   b. The interface data specified in a., by component, shall be organized showing the complete interfaces map, using as appropriate diagrams or matrices supporting their cross–checking.
   c. For each identified internal interface, all the defined data elements shall be included.
       NOTE: The amount of detail to be provided depends strongly on the type of component.
   d. The logical and physical data structure of files that interface major component should be postponed to the detailed design.
   e. Data structure definitions shall include:
       1. the description of each element (e.g. name, type, dimension);
       2. the relationships between the elements (i.e. the structure);
       3. the initial values of each element.

The internal interface design is limited to the interactions between different procedures.

For each procedure :ref:`Software Components Design – Aspects of Each Component` describes which other procedures are called.
